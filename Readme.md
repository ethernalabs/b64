## TO DO
- lessen binary file size
- better error handling on decoding

## Installing
You just need to copy the binary to a place that is included in your `$PATH`

eg. `cp b64 $HOME/.local/bin/`

## Building from source

Compile the code to binary
```
#at the moment i'm using rust v1.57
cargo build --release
```
